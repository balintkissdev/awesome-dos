[<img src="logo.svg" align="right" width="100">](https://github.com/balintkissdev/awesome-dos)

A curated list of references for development of DOS applications and learning
about the system itself. This includes list of compilers, tutorials, videos,
links to free and paid books and source code to DOS operating systems and DOS
games. The goal of this list is to collect information and act as a starting
point for someone who wants to start out retro-programming for the DOS
platform.
